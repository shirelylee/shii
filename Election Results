Hint #1
To find out who won the election, we need to calculate the total number of votes received by each candidate. However, we also need to take into account that if a person votes for multiple candidates, their vote gets equally split across these candidates.

Hint #2
To calculate the total number of votes received by each candidate, we first need to remove any rows where the candidate is missing. We can do this by using the ~ operator to negate the condition voting_results['candidate'].isna(). This will give us a new DataFrame with only the rows where the candidate is not missing.

Next, we need to calculate the vote value for each voter. We can do this by applying a lambda function to the 'voter' column. The lambda function divides 1 by the total number of times the voter appears in the DataFrame. This will give us the vote value for each voter.

Finally, we can group the DataFrame by the 'candidate' column and sum the vote values for each candidate. We can then reset the index to get a new DataFrame with the candidate names and their total vote values.

Keep going! You're on the right track!

Hint #3
To determine the winner of the election, we need to find the candidate(s) with the highest vote value. We can do this by rounding the vote values to 3 decimal places using the round() function and then ranking them in descending order using the rank() function with the method='min' parameter.

We can create a new column called 'place' in the DataFrame to store the rankings. We can then filter the DataFrame to only include the rows where the 'place' column is equal to 1, indicating the candidate(s) with the highest vote value.

    lambda x: 1/(voting_results["voter"]==x).sum()

    voting_results.groupby("candidate").sum().reset_index()
    )   
voting_results["place"]=(
    voting_results["vote_value"].round(3).rank(ascending=False,method="min")
    )
result=voting_results[voting_results["place"]==1]["candidate"]
